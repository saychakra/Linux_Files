# Some program configuration files and dot files for Linux
My personal configuration files for 
- zsh 
- vim and neovim (along with all installed plugin supports)
- Howdy (codes for removing storage of recurrent face recognition snapshots)


## Notes for NeoVim configuration
### Points
- Autopopup and supertab needs to removed for CoC to work
- As of the "nvim" folder, directly copy it and paste in "~/.config/" , (replace the existing empty nvim directory)
- The folder coc, contains the required coc config files along with the installed extensions <br>
    Copy and paste it "~/.config/" path.

### Important links

1. If CoC is being used then, there can be some problems for clangd. Follow the instructions of installation of clangd as mentioned here:
https://clangd.llvm.org/installation.html <br>
After that do a CocInstall coc-clangd. If required run the CocCommand if prompted.<br>
    Reasons:<br>
        - clangd is available on snapcraft, PLEASE do not install it. It is old and the application gets installed in the /snap directory which will require to create symlinks to the user/bin folder. All the more the clang server is broken and does not start up. <br>
        - Install clang-latest version from the link provided and run the commands mentioned below to run clangd10 or clangd11 as the default clangd command.

2. If there is an error with python complete regarding import jedi. Just go ahead and do a `python3 -m pip install jedi`, which should resolve it.
